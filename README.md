####By Nate Ivy and Bryant Morrill
----



This is a WPF application written in C# . It is a children's game that is a spinoff of the popular whack-a-mole game. You are a child in your bedroom at night and monsters spawn increasingly faster as night progresses. You have 165 seconds to stop as many arms as possible. You have 2 seconds to hit each arm before it disappears and you lose points from your score.

This game features custom XAML buttons and lots of DispatcherTimer.
